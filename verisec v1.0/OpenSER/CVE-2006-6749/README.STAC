- parse_config_bad.c:
    After analyzing this file with STAC, both initial problems are marked as BAD by STAC
    (the call to 'r_strncpy' and the statement 'str2[j-start+1] = EOS;'), but also we 
    obtain two false positives in the 'parse_expression' function because no value analysis
    is performed before running STAC.

- guard_random_index_bad.c:
    After analyzing this file with STAC the call to 'r_strcpy' is marked as BAD because a
    tainted buffer is copied into another buffer (without untainted bounds).

- guard_strchr_bad.c:
    After analyzing this file with STAC the call to 'r_strcpy' is marked as BAD because a
    tainted buffer is copied into another buffer (without untainted bounds). We also obtain
    a false positive on the call to 'strncpy' because no value analysis is performed prior to
    taint analysis.
    
- guard_strstr_bad.c:
    After analyzing this file with STAC the call to 'r_strcpy' is marked as BAD because a
    tainted buffer is copied into another buffer (without untainted bounds). We also obtain
    a false positive on the call to 'strncpy' because no value analysis is performed prior to
    taint analysis.
