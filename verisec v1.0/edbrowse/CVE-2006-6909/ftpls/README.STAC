Analysis results for 'edbrowse':

- no_strcmp_bad.c:
    After analyzing this file with STAC, the r_strcpy call is marked as BAD because
    a tainted buffer is copied into an untainted buffer. Also the assignment 
    'out[out_l] = (char )c;' is marked as unsafe because a tainted value is used for 
    indexing the buffer when writing into it.

- strchr_bad.c:

    buffer overflow in the 'ftpls' function, __the parameter passed to the function is 
    never user dependent__.
