bsd-mailx for DEBIAN
----------------------

The history of this package is quite complicated. The changelog
includes a summary with the different maintainers.

At the beginning of Debian, I think this package was based on a BSD 5.5 
mail version from FreeBSD.

There has been a lot on work on the package shipped with Debian
0.93R6, which was based a BSD 8.1 mail version from BSD4.4Lite.  The
extensions includes support for dotfile locking, setgid support, POP
support, signal handling hacks.

here is a README originally found:
  + README for Berkely mailx version 8.1 with POP extension
  + 
  + This is "mailx", a simple program for sending and receiving email.
  + 
  + This is based on mailx version 8.1 (as distributed with BSD 4.4lite).
  + 
  + It has been extended to support the post-office protocol (POP).  Run
  + "mail -p" and it will retrive your email from a POP server rather than
  + from your local mail queue.  See the manual page for more details.
  + 
  + The POP support was written by Jonathan I. Kamens for version mailx 5.5
  + (as distributed with BSD 4.3.)
  + 
  + The POP support was integrated into version 8.1 by Salvatore Valente
  + for no particular reason.  (It would have been simpler for me to
  + simply use Jonathan's 5.5 source tree.  There are no major differences
  + between the two versions.)
  + 
  + Have a nice day.

  + PORTING
  + 
  + Before attempting to compile this for _any_ system, you should do two
  + things:
  + 
  + Edit CFLAGS in Makefile.
  + Edit pathnames.h.
  + 
  + These sources are _extremely_ BSDish.  I have successfully built this
  + for Linux, BSD 4.3, NetBSD, Ultrix, Aix, and SunOS.  I have never
  + successfully gotten it to build for Solaris or any System 5ish system.
  + If you want to try, here are some issues you will face:
  + 
  + It uses BSD signal() semantics.  Use sigaction().
  + It uses BSD longjmp() semantics.  Use siglongjmp().
  + It uses BSD sgtty.  Use termios.
  + It uses BSD signal mask functions.  Use posix sigmask functions.
  + 
  + There will probably be other hurdles too.  Good luck.


With Debian1.1 a switch was done to a version base on a BSD5.5 mail
program, because of signal handling problems (which I think were due
to bad compilation options). So no more POP support. Some patches
from Ken Whang <Kenneth.C.Whang-1@umn.edu> included, the corresponding
README was:
  + mailx-5.5-kw 5/30/95
  + 
  + 
  + WHAT'S IN THIS PATCH
  + 
  + There are a bunch of little features, common in System V and SunOS
  + versions of mailx, that are missing from the NetBSD-based version
  + distributed with Linux.  This patch attempts to fill in some of what's
  + missing.
  + 
  + Changes from debian mailx-5.5 include:
  + 
  + 5/4/95:
  + 
  + -- interpret prompt variable
  + -- interpret ~a and ~A tilde escapes
  + -- updated tildehelp list
  + -- changed mail.rc to ignore nothing (just my personal preference)
  + -- accept From lines with times of the form hh:mm (formerly took only hh:mm:ss)
  + 
  + 5/7/95:
  + 
  + -- Save (S) command saves to mailbox named after author
  + -- take startup commands from file named by environment variable MAILRC
  + 
  + 5/30/95:
  + 
  + -- -H switch for header summary only
  + 
  + Still to be done:
  + 
  + -- pipe ~p output through PAGER (see type1 in cmd1.c for an example)
  + -- save (s) by default to MBOX (instead of "No file specified.")
  + -- ~q should save to dead.letter, ~x is not known
  + -- update man page
  + -- allnet and showto ("showto" shows recipient instead of sender if sender
  +    is current user)
  + 
  + Possibly difficult:
  + 
  + -- interpret editheaders variable as in SunOS version
  + 
  + Bugs:
  + 
  + -- ~a,~A tilde escapes leave an extra trailing blank on each line
  + -- to conform to original style, I should really be using char *cp
  +    instead of new variables sig and prompt to be looking up variables
  + -- -H switch implementation is kind of gross.  grep for "hdronly" in
  +    source files; much room for improvement!
  + 
  + 
  + HOW TO INSTALL
  + 
  + Apply Sal Valente's debian patch first, so:
  + 
  +    tar xvfz mailx-5.5.tar.gz
  +    cd mailx-5.5
  +    zcat ../mailx-5.5.debian.diff.gz | patch -p1
  +    zcat ../mailx-5.5-kw.diff.gz | patch -p1
  +    make
  + 
  + Or you may wish to just uncompress the diff file and pick and choose
  + the changes that you like.

This version has no provision for the debian mail policy (permission
on /var/mail+dotfile locking), so Loic Prylli
<lprylli@graville.fdn.fr> finally recreate a package based on the OpenBSD
mail with the minimum number of patches to make it suited for debian
(see changelog). There is no more POP support, nor the added
functionality from Ken Whang, but all these patches are archived, so
mail <lprylli@graville.fdn.fr> if you want them to be incorporated.

After a  security patch  to fix tmp races, a number of things broke.
Here is what I have tried to fix them:
The rationale is to have all file openings go through safe_open:
File opened in mode "w", "w+",  are created with O_EXCL mode,
 (should coincide with temporary files or new files)
Files with "a" "a+" et "r+" mode do not require the O_EXCL files. "a+" et "r+" do not creat the file. 


Still to do: check creat calls
