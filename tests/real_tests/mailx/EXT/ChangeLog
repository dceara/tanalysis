2001-09-16 15:27  millert

	* aux.c:

	1) In skin(), only add a space after a comma if there is actually a space
	in the input buffer.  This prevents a rare buffer overflow on very long
	header lines where one or more entries has a comment in it but the
	entries have no space after the comma *and* the amount of extra space
	needed to add a space after each comma is greater than the length of
	the comments that will be removed.  This is debian bug #108677

	2) In skin(), use a temporary variable in the realloc() and don't
	die if realloc() fails since its only purpose is to shrink the
	buffer, not expand it (and thus is not fatal).
