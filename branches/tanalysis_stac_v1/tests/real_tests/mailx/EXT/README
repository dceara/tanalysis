This directory is not part of upstream source, but it contains files
which are needed to compile current CVS snapshots of mailx.

Files strlcat.c and strlcmp.c were taken from OpenBSD CVS repository
module src/lib/libc/string.
File vis.c was taken from module src/lib/libc/gen, and vis.h from
module src/include.

File bsd_utils.h was written by me.

ChangeLog was generated using `cvs2cl --no-wrap --gmt -S' command.
